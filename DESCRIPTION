Description: DFEAT is an innovative and fully automated tool designed to characterize and extract annual drought features over consecutive hydrological years,
    using any simulated or observed soil water content time series. This tool, standardized for use through the widely recognized Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) as a daily
    soil water balance metric, calculates 19 annual drought features related to the duration, severity, onset, offset, drying and wetting rates,
    driest peak day, and rainfall pulses. These features are assessed across three soil desiccation thresholds, representing soil moisture loss and recovery at 25%, 50%, and 75%
    of total available water content under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The DFEAT package covers all aspects of drought analysis, from daily climate data pre-processing to KBDI calculation
    and drought feature extraction, providing users with a comprehensive set of functions that work sequentially to produce a final table of extracted drought features for the userâ€™s region of interest. 
    The 'DFEAT' package requires only daily climate data as input, specifically daily precipitation 'prec' and maximum temperature 'Tmax', structure in a data frame with three aditional columns; 'year', 'month', and 'day'
